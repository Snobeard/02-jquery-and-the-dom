## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Building a template to simplify additional blog entries. Building towards a fully functional blogging website.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1) Fork said repo
2) Clone said repo
3) Navigate into directory and switch to a working branch
4) Create a constructor function that contains instances of articles from raw data
5) Use jQuery to clone the template
6) Replace the template placeholders with article instance parameters
7) Render each article onto the web page based on their attributes given by the raw data
8) Hide the template

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
In terms of technology, we used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery.  Today we used the CSS from the day prior, which already matched the client's specifications, then added a display: none to the template class.
